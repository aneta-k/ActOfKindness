## About project 
Act of Kindness is the culmination of a year-long programming course at Codecool. Over a span of six weeks, our team was tasked with building a web application from scratch. This web app aims to connect users on a meaningful level, different from typical social media platforms, by linking helpers with people in need and fostering real-life interactions.
